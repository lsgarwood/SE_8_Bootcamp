The Java Platform
- The Java platform has two components
	- The Java Vrtual Machine(JVM)
	- The Java Application Programming Interface (API) - bunch of libraries we get to use
	- can run groovy, scala, Clojure that run on the java platform
	- The JVM and the Java API together make up the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- In Java applications are both compiled and interpreted
	- The Java compiles your application source code to an intermediate language that is interpreted by the JVM
	- Source code -> compiler -> intermediate lang (byte code) -> interpreted by JVM
	- Bytecode is not machine code that gets executed directly
	- Instead, the JVM translates (iinterprets) the bytecode into machine code, which then gets run by the actual platform
- In other words bytecode is 2like machine code" for the JVM
	- The bytecode is platform independent and can therefore by interpreted by any JVM
	- JVMs are built specific to partcular platforms (hardware and OS)
	
Editions and Version of Java
- Unfortunately, one of the more complex aspects of Java is that there is no single Java platform
	- As you have already learned, there are many different JVMs. A JVM is created for each hardware/OS platform
	- In addition, there are several "editions" of Java. 
	- Depenedant on which addition of Java you have downloaded, different libraries will be available in the API
	- Three primary editions : Java EE, Java SE, and Java ME
	- Java Enterprise Edition - super set of Java for distribution applications for web 
	- Java Standard Edition - regular features to write applications
	- Java Micro Edition - resurgence with IoT devices
	- JavaFX - for creating GUIs - after edition 8 is now bundled with Java SE 
	- Each of these editions targets different kinds of applications running on different types of hardware
- Started as JDK - Java Development Environment
- Changed in 1998 to J2SE
- Java SE 8 - 2008

Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Often installed into c - program files- java (- JVM - JDK)
	- 2nd folder JRE - Api and jdk
- Inside - Home - bin- All of our tools exist in bin directory e.g Java, java c, java doc etc
- db - simple data base
- include - advanced programs in other languages like c++
- jre - allow us to run programs
- lib - where java api lives
- man - manual files for the different java tools
- src.zip - all of source code for jave se 8 api
